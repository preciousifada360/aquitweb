                                    <p>12.1&nbsp; Technical adjustments. Acquits Group participation may require you to configure your software settings on your web-device upon first use.</p>

                                    <p>12.2&nbsp; No diagnosis or assessment. Acquits peer support groups do not involve the diagnosis or treatment of mental disorders as defined by the National Psychiatric Association. Acquits Group support is not a substitute
                                        for counseling, psychotherapy, psychoanalysis, mental health care, medical treatment or substance abuse treatment and the Acquits user will not use it in place of any form of diagnosis, treatment or therapy.&nbsp;
                                        Nothing contained in this Site or App is intended to be used as medical advice or to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.</p>

                                    <p>12.3&nbsp; No prescription or treatment. Although Acquits Group Leaders offer encouragement and while groups provide a chance to explore possibilities, they in no case dictate or “prescribe” a specific course of action.
                                        The assistance of a Acquits Group is not a substitute for independent professional advice from a medical/health professional – nor does it replace professional advice by legal, financial, business, spiritual or other
                                        qualified professionals. Acquits users are encouraged to seek independent professional guidance for legal, medical, financial, business, spiritual or other matters. Acquits users should not stop a medication or treatment
                                        protocol or alter your treatment plan without first consulting their mental health, medical or healthcare provider(s). All decisions in these areas are exclusively that of the individual Acquits user and she/he acknowledges
                                        that her/his decisions and actions regarding personal mental or emotional wellness are her/his sole responsibility.</p>

                                    <p>12.4&nbsp; Incidental discussion about professional intervention. Discussion of any particular personal or professional intervention during group meetings by any participant does not indicate endorsement from Acquits.&nbsp;
                                        Acquits does not endorse or recommend the use of any specific professional intervention for addiction – or any other mental, emotional or physical condition.&nbsp; For advice about specific interventions, individuals
                                        should consult a medical practitioner or mental health care provider.&nbsp;</p>

                                    <p>12.5&nbsp; Acquits Group Leaders. Acquits support groups are overseen by a trained group leader. Information and encouragement shared by this leader is expected to meet a certain ethical and practice standard, with accountability
                                        and supervision safeguards in place to ensure that happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>

                                    <p>12.6&nbsp; Liability. Acquits users are fully responsible for themselves and their actions within and outside of a Acquits Group. They are liable for possible damages if incurred. Acquits is released from any liability
                                        claims, except if these are based on intentional harmful behavior of the Acquits group leader.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <br>

                                    <p>12.7&nbsp; Confidentiality.&nbsp; Acquits Group Leaders will not at any time, either directly or indirectly, voluntarily use any personal information from Acquits users for the group leader's own benefit, or disclosure,
                                        or communicate this information to a third party.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <br>

                                    <p>12.8&nbsp; Exceptions to confidentiality. For the purposes of Acquits support groups, user information, including email address, may be provided to the designated support group leader so that they may contact users regarding
                                        the support group.&nbsp; Acquits users also recognize that the Group Leader may consult with their Acquits supervisor or Acquits team leaders as well.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <br>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>12.9&nbsp; Duty to report. The general requirement that a group leader keeps information confidential does not apply when disclosure is required to comply with government laws governing individuals. When deemed appropriate
                                        at its sole discretion, Acquits may provide user information, including identifying information that may have been entered into the Site or App by the user, to authorized law enforcement agencies. Such situations
                                        include but are not limited to child pornography, child abuse, and a rape of a child, as well evidence of the abuse, assault or rape of an adult. Any of these situations would constitute disclosure to the proper
                                        authorities. In cases of threatened self-harm, or threatened (or actual) harm to an adult friend or family member, we may also take action to disclose information, on a case by case basis.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>12.10&nbsp; Group updates. Acquits reserves the right to modify or change the rules of the support groups without prior notification to current or new users. Any substantial modifications or changes, of course, would
                                        be subsequently shared with current and new users.</p>
